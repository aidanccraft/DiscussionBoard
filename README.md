# Discussion Board
This discussion board was created to be used in a seminar class by <a href=https://github.com/AstrosBoy15>@AstrosBoy15</a>. <a href=https://github.com/Elitearcanist>@Elitearcanist</a> and <a href=https://github.com/pie-tras>@pie-tras</a> provided some help on the websites visuals.

This website works by allowing users into open rooms based off of the password they input. When they join a room they will be able to see all previously sent messages and they can send messages to the rest of the room. A room will reset when it has no occupants remaining in it.

## Usage
The website can be run by calling ```node server.js``` from the root directory. It is currently setup to be used on localhost only.

## Project Details
This project was created using Node.js and server.IO.

## Future Features
In the future, the ability to create new rooms should be available from the website itself rather than having to do so in server.js. Adding the option for enhanced messages (italics and bold font, images, replies, etc.) would also make the website more usable overall. Setting the website up to be run from an external website, rather than locally, would also help to make it more functional if it were to be used by a large group.
